About PANDETECT:
PANDETECT is an integrated system that will detect whether people in a particular area
obey social distance rules and whether they wear masks or not. It consists of two separate
applications one in the form of a desktop and one in the form of a mobile application. The main
goal of the mobile application is to identify places that do not comply with pandemic rules such
as restaurants, workplaces, and public areas. In this way, it is expected to increase the control in
the places where do not comply with the rules. This information will be shared on a map in the
PANDETECT mobile application using the data of the places where rules are followed and not
followed. That way, people can choose not to go to areas where the rules are not followed
according to the map provided.
